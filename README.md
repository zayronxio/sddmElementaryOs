# elementary SDDM Theme 🚀

A sleek and modern SDDM login theme inspired by the elegant design of elementary OS's greeter. Bring the clean and user-friendly look of elementary OS to your SDDM login screen!.
sddm does not have in its API the possibility of obtaining the wallpaper of each user and as a result of this a more similar imitation is not possible
